Feature: Default content
  In order to be able to showcase the site's features
  As a developer
  I want to make sure that the exported default content is correctly imported

  Scenario: Commission landing page content is correctly imported
    When I am on "the jobs growth and investment page"
    And I click "English"
    
    # Then I should be on "/en/commission/priorities/jobs-growth-and-investment"
    Then I should be on "/en/priorities/jobs-growth-and-investment"

    # Then the site switcher link "Commission and its priorities" is active
    But the site switcher link "Policies, information and services" is not active

    And I should see the heading "Jobs, growth and investment" in the "page header" region
    And I should see the link "Home" in the "breadcrumb" region
    # And I should see the link "Priorities" in the "breadcrumb" region
    
    And I should see the link "The Investment Plan for Europe" in the "content" region
